I am a theoretical linguistic currently working on the pragmatics-phonology interface as part of my PhD research at the University of Vienna. More specificallt, I investigate the prosody of information packaging in British English from a functional perspective. The theoretical framework I employ in my research is Functional Discourse Grammar. You can learn more about the theory, its basic architecture, as well as the researchers active in the field [here](http://www.functionaldiscoursegrammar.org/). Since 2021, I am also a member of the Fun\*Cog research group. More information about who we are and what we do can be found [here](https://anglistik.univie.ac.at/staff/teams-and-research-areas/funcog/).
