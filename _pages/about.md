Originally from Upper Austria, I studied _English and American Studies_, as well as _Slavonic Studies_ (Russian) at the University of Vienna. In 2017, I continued into the MA program _English Language & Linguistics_ at the University of Vienna, from which I graduated with distinction in 2020. In 2021, I started a position as a pre-doc university assistant in English linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna, where I am part of the Fun\*Cog research group. More information about who we are and what we do can be found under <https://anglistik.univie.ac.at/staff/teams-and-research-areas/funcog/>. 

My research interests revolve around the interaction between pragmatics and intonation, specifically the prosody of information packaging. In my dissertation, I am investigating the prosodic realisation of Topic, Focus, and Contrast as well as their combinations. Moreover, as part of my research, I also explore how prosody and information packaging interact with syntax, focussing on a number of information packaging phenomena such as dislocations and cleft sentences. In my research, I adopt a functional-cognitive approach. More specifically, I work within the framework of Functional Discourse Grammar (see <http://www.functionaldiscoursegrammar.org/>).
