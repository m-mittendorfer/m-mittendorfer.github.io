My name is Matthias and I am a pre-doc university assistant in English linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna.

My research focuses on the interaction between pragmatics and intonation, specifically the prosody of information packaging. In my dissertation, I am investigating the prosodic realisation of Topic, Focus, and Contrast as well as their combinations and a number of information packaging constructions in Standard Southern British. My approach to these phenomena is firmly functional-cognitive in nature. More specifically, I subscribe the framework of Functional Discourse Grammar (FDG) in most of my work.

Originally from Upper Austria, I studied _English and American Studies_, as well as _Slavonic Studies_ (Russian) at the University of Vienna. In 2017, I continued into the MA program _English Language & Linguistics_ at the University of Vienna, from which I graduated with distinction in 2020.
