My name is Matthias and I am a pre-doc university assistant in English linguistics at the Department of English and American Studies at the University of Vienna. My theoretical orientation is firmly based in functional-cognitive approaches, in particular Functional Discourse Grammar (FDG) and Cognitive Linguistics. I'm interested in all things phonological, but specifically in the pragmatics-prosody interface. Currently, I'm working on the prosody of information structure in Standard Southern British.  The aim of this project is to not only gain a deeper inside into the interaction between pragmatics and intonation, but also to develop (the phonological part of) FDG further.

Originally from Upper Austria, I studied _English and American Studies_, as well as _Slavonic Studies_ (Russian) at the University of Vienna. In 2017, I continued into teh MA program _English Language & Linguistics_ at the University of Vienna from which I graduated with distinction in 2020.
